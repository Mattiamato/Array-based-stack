Task B): Array Based Stack

We have a football card game and the deck of the game is implemented as a stack. We
are not interested in the mechanics of the game but only in the functionality of the deck.
A stack provides those functions; constructor(), destructor(), pop(), push(), top(), empty(),
size().

1) Implementation

The header file is already provided and the main.cpp is filled with code to test the
card deck with FC Barcelona. Your exercise is to implement all the functions in the
stack_ab.cpp .
Hint: Be aware of stack over/underflow, try to get the knowledge of exceptions (for
later usage).
